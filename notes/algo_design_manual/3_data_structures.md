A data structure is an implementation of an abstract data type.

***"Changing a data structure in a slow program can work the same way an organ transplant does in a sick patient. But it is better to be born with a good heart than to wait for a replacement. The maximum benefit from good data structures results from designing your program around them in the first place."***

The 3 fundamental abstract data types: (we'll implement them with arrays and lists)
1. Containers
2. Dictionaries
3. Priority Queues

Changing the data structure does not change the correctness of the program, since we presumably *replace a correct implementation with a different correct implementation*. However, the *new implementation of the data type realizes different tradeoffs in the time to execute various operations*, so the *total performance can improve dramatically.*
