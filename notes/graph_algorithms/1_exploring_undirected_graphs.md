## Exploring graphs

Algorithms for exploring graphs.

**Objectives:**
* Implement the **"explore"** algorithms
* Figure out whether or not one vertex of a graph is **"reachable"** from another

**Path** - A path in a graph G is a sequence of vertices v<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>, ..., v<sub>n</sub>
